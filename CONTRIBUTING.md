## How can you help the Open Teach R project?

If you know a little bit of R and would like to see more people using it, then you can help! Having some experience in teaching it makes things even better, but that's not a prerequisite to join.

**Roughly speaking, we need two kinds of contributors (but you can be a mix of them):**
 - You can help building courseware if you have some experience in using or teaching R;
 - You can help testing the material as it is being built if you want to try teaching with it, even if you never done that before.

**Also, we would love to get help at leats two non R related issues:**
 - I live and work in Brazil, and I would love to get all the material translated to Portuguese;
 - It would be great for this project to have a nice looking and easy to use website, and any help with that would be really amazing.
 
You can start getting involved in the project just by saying [hi here](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/issues/1) and talking a little bit about yourself and how you can help us. Also, you can (and tottaly should!) plan to join us at the [Global Sprint in June](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/).
 
More info might be coming soon to this file, but the project is ready to start, so you can contact us at anytime! ;)
